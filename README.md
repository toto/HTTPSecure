About
----
A simple Safari extension that secures Facebook by using *https* instead of *http*. 

This protects agains you against many nasty things that anybody with a bit of knowlege in network securtiy (or [Firesheep](http://codebutler.github.com/firesheep/)) can do.

- Cookie stealing attacks which have been demonstrated so well in [Firesheep](http://codebutler.github.com/firesheep/).
- Data sniffing
- Traffic manipulation 
- and other nasty [Man in the Middle attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)

TODO
----
The plan is to extended this to many popular sites (e.g. http*s*://twitter.com). 

Known Problems
--------------

- First loading is not suppressed. _Workaround:_ You should update your bookmarks, etc. to *https*.
